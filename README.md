# Crime Rate Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Crime Rate Prediction Project. The project aims to predict crime rates in a given area based on various factors and historical data. The predictions can help law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers to understand crime patterns, allocate resources effectively, and devise strategies to reduce crime rates.

## Project Overview

Crime rate prediction is a challenging task due to the complex nature of crime patterns. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that takes into account various factors such as demographics, socio-economic indicators, and historical crime data to forecast crime rates in a specific area.

The project follows the typical machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It also provides an interface for users to input specific features and generate crime rate predictions for a given location.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical crime data and relevant features for each geographical area. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset used in this repository is a synthesized and anonymized version, which closely resembles real-world crime datasets.

The dataset is available in the `data` directory and is divided into training and testing subsets.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crime-rate-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```shell
   cd crime-rate-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment.
   - On Windows:
     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies.
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project provides a command-line interface to interact with the crime rate prediction model. To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have activated the virtual environment (if created).

2. Run the following command to start the program:
   ```shell
   python crime_prediction.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary features for prediction.

4. Receive the predicted crime rate for the specified area.

## Model Training

The model training process is handled by the `train_model.py` script. It utilizes the training dataset to train the machine learning model. You can modify the script to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques.

To train the model, run the following command:
```shell
python train_model.py
```

After training, the script saves the trained model as a file for later use.

## Evaluation

The `evaluate_model.py` script allows you to evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing dataset. It provides metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).

To evaluate the model, run the following command:
```shell
python evaluate_model.py
```

The script loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on the testing dataset.
